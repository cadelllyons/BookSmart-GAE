BookSmart: Buying/Selling Books Mobile Application 
====================================================
 The purpose of this mobile application is to act as a medium for persons wanting to easily 
buy and sell books. Users will be able to create a listing and set its price. A user could then click 
on this listing and be able to contact the seller of the book. When posting a book the user will be 
able to scan the barcode behind the book, retrieving its ISBN number and any other information 
about the book for easier posting. The user will also be able to state the condition of the book. 
The app will also record the user location. This will aid when searching for a particular book 
within a userâ€™s area. A user will also be able to update a previous post changing its price, 
location and condition of the book.
